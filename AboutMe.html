            <h1>I'm Errol <span>Mabusela</span></h1>
            <p> a future-fit Java Learner from Johannesburg where I grew up nurturing my curiosity and 
                diverse <br>interests. With extensive years in client services, I amplify my passion for connecting with people.<br>
                 I actively engaged in education and social awareness initiatives. 
                As an Accounting graduate,<br> I volunteered my Bookkeeping skills to local NGOs, 
                actively engaged in educational and social <br>awareness initiatives, believing in the power of positive change. Now, I'm
                drawn to Coding <br>and currently studying towards a National Certificate in Systems Development, 
                seeing it as a <br>pivotal skill for the fourth industrial revolution. With a foundation
                in creativity and curiosity, <br>I seek a career that expresses these qualities and contributes to global progress.
                Joining the <br>technology industry is a long-held dream, driven by the prospect of daily
                problem-solving and <br>critical thinking. Beyond personal fulfilment, I recognize the job security it
                offers in an <br>ever-evolving landscape. I'm ready for the challenges and triumphs of Coding and
                Tech, <br>let's shape a future where passion meets purpose, and innovation becomes second nature.
